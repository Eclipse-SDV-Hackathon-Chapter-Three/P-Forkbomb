## Challenge  
SDV_Lab -> ADAS feature

## Core Idea  
Traffic Jam Speed Optimization: <br>
Our vision is a connected vehicle grid where cars share real-time data to prevent collisions and create safer, synchronized traffic flow, for the driver and bystanders. As a small-scale prototype of this vision, we developed an ADAS feature that combines Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Keeping Assist, reacting to the signal received by the car in front, to guide speed, distance, and lane decisions, which would be a second factor in decision making of our vehicle, that can be overruled in case of any unexpected scenario

# 2. How Do You Work

## Development Process  
*Brief overview of your development process.*

### Planning & Tracking  
Our progress is tracked in GitHub Projects, and we plan our tasks through Issues.

### Quality Assurance  
To ensure quality, we idealize a validation to our prototype through repeated testing in different traffic scenarios with two to three cars connected with multiple edge cases. 

## Communication  
Our team communicates primarily by face-to-face  communication and online messaging platforms, when outside of regular hours. This allows us to quickly exchange ideas, update progress, and resolve blockers in real time.

## Decision Making  
Decisions were made collaboratively, with discussions to weigh pros and cons. When disagreements arise, we prioritized feasibility and alignment with our core vision to reach consensus efficiently, and not diverge much from the proposed feature.
